> I didn't understand yet why we need labels. The post says "we believe that the client should provide an unique label for each transaction it sends", because this didn't connect to the rest of the post in my mind. Maybe I need to understand better how the recovery will work, with a practical use case.

A scenario:

The client wishes to send a transaction that we will refer to as transaction A.
The client calls `send_transaction` giving transaction A as an argument.
Immediately after sending the transaction, the transaction is in one of four (excluding) states:
1. Waiting to be sent to the transaction pool.
2. In the transaction pool waiting to be mined.
3. In a block and waiting for a number X of confirmations.
4. Confirmed but not yet returned from `send_transaction`.

The program crashes.
The client get restarted.
Imagining that the program crashes before `send_transaction` returns, the transaction manager will perform the recovery and

the client does not know in which of these states the transaction was in. However, u



In my understanding labels allows the client to be somewhat stateless when interacting with the transaction manager.
